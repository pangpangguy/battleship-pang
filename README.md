# battleship-template
Getting Started: Battleship Project in React and Typescript

## New repository setup
1. Use this template to create a new repository in GitHub
2. Follow the naming convention: `battleship-XX` using the initials of the newbie
3. On the new repository, add branch protection rules for the `master` branch to enforce PRs and approvals for merging code to `master`
4. On the new repository, add collaborators (team leads & supervisor & mentor as `admin` role, newbie as `maintain` role)
